# Data Science Project Portfolio

This portfolio is continously populated with projects as they become available. The structure of this portfolio is based on sections which address different types of techniques and analyses such as exploration, clustering, classification, time series and more. The projects are loaded as iPython Notebooks. Dataset used in the projects or any other references can all be found in the begining of each notebook.

Enjoy :smiley:

Thanks,

Ali
