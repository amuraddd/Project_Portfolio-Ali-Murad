# Data Science Project Portfolio

This portfolio is a work in progress and will be populated with more projects and analysis in the near future. The structure of the portfolio will be based on sections with different types of analyses such as clustering, classification, time series and much more. The projects are loaded as iPython Notebooks. Dataset used in the projects or any other references can all be found in the begining of each notebook.

Thanks,

Ali
