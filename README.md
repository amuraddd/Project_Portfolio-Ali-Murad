## Data Science and Analytics Project Portfolio

This portfolio is consistently populated with projects as they become available. The structure of this portfolio is based on sections which address different types of techniques and analyses such as exploration, clustering, classification, time series and more. The projects are loaded as iPython Notebooks. Dataset used in these projects or any other references can all be found at the begining of each notebook.

Enjoy :smiley:

Thanks,

Ali

### Data Exploration:
- [Data Exploration and Analysis of major stock indices.](https://github.com/amuraddd/Project_Portfolio-Ali-Murad/blob/master/Data%20Exploration%20of%20Major%20Stock%20Indices.ipynb)

--------------------
### Time Series Analysis and Forecasting:

### Classification
#### Lending Club Data Analysis: Application of Machine Learning techniques to Loan Default Prediction
This project is built in collaboration with Brandon Moragne and Maycie McKay as our Final Practicum for Masters in Data Science at Lipscomb University. Algorithms used in this project include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

## Dasboards
### Economic Indicators in Microsoft Power BI
This dashboards containes three seperate tabs with visuals mostly describing the state of different economic indicators as measured by trading economics. The inidcators are analyzed by regions and countries. They rovide the over health of economies through measures such as GDP, FDI Inflows, Tax Burdens, Business Freedom and more.
