## Project Portfolio

This portfolio is consistently populated with projects as they become available. The structure of this portfolio is based on sections which address different types of techniques and analyses such as exploration, clustering, classification, time series and more. Dataset used in these projects or any other references can all be found at the begining of each notebook.

Enjoy :smiley:

Thanks,

Ali

------------------
### Data Exploration:
- [Data Exploration and Analysis of major stock indices.](https://github.com/amuraddd/Project_Portfolio-Ali-Murad/blob/master/Data%20Exploration%20of%20Major%20Stock%20Indices.ipynb)

--------------------
### Time Series Analysis and Forecasting:
- [Forecasting the level of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=SO_{2}"> in Seoul, Korea.](https://github.com/amuraddd/Project_Portfolio-Ali-Murad/blob/master/Air%20Pollution%20in%20Seoul%20Korea.ipynb)

--------------------
### Classification
#### Lending Club Data Analysis: Application of Machine Learning techniques to Loan Default Prediction
This project is built in collaboration with Brandon Moragne and Maycie McKay as our Final Practicum for Masters in Data Science at Lipscomb University. Algorithms used in this project include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
- [Loan Default Prediction on Lending Club Loan Data.](https://github.com/amuraddd/Project_Portfolio-Ali-Murad/blob/master/LendingClubLoanDefaultPrediction.ipynb)

--------------------
### Network Analysis Using Graphs
#### Network Visualization and Vulnerability Detection:
This project will demonstrate how to visually present a collection of nodes in a graph followed by the application of Karger's Minimu Cut Contraction algorithm to find the minimum cut of the graph. The minimum cut of a graph can help spot the vulnerabilities in a network. These vulnerabilities are represented as edges(connections) between nodes(endpoints.) Addressing such vulnerabilities can help strengthen the network.

### Algorithms

#### Quick Sort
- [Quick Sort Implementation in Python](https://github.com/amuraddd/Project_Portfolio-Ali-Murad/blob/master/Quick%20Sort.py)
- [To run the code above use the QuickSort.txt file.](https://github.com/amuraddd/Project_Portfolio-Ali-Murad/blob/master/QuickSort.txt)
- Save both(code and data) files at the same location before executing the code.

## Dasboards
### Economic Indicators in Microsoft Power BI
This dashboards containes three seperate tabs with visuals mostly describing the state of different economic indicators as measured by trading economics. The inidcators are analyzed by regions and countries. They provide the over health of economies through measures such as GDP, FDI Inflows, Tax Burdens, Business Freedom and more. These are PNG files uploaded as screen shots of the actual interactive dashboard.

 - [Economic Indicators 2.](https://github.com/amuraddd/Project_Portfolio-Ali-Murad/blob/master/Economic%20Freedom%20Indicators.PNG)
 - [FDI, Inflation, and Taxes.](https://github.com/amuraddd/Project_Portfolio-Ali-Murad/blob/master/FDI%2C%20Inflation%2C%20and%20Taxes.PNG)
